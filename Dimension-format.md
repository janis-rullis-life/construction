Listed dimensions for boxes are always inside dimensions.

* The first dimension is length (L).
 * Length is always the longest side of the box that has a flap.
* The second dimension is width (W).
 * Width is the second longest side with a flap.
* The third dimension is height (H).
 * Height is the only dimension without a flap.
